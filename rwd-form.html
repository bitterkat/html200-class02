    <h1>What is Responsive Web Design?</h1>
    <p>Have you ever opened a website on your smartphone, only to find that the text is really small and you have to zoom in to get the most basic information? Over a decade ago, websites were all styled to deliver content at specific, common widths. It was expected that the user would be using a desktop computer and keyboard and could scroll around, if necessary, and that the text would generally be readable. When users started using different types of media (smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles) to access web content, even the most basic information on a site was sometimes completely useless and inaccessible. Responsive Web Design (RWD) solves this problem by flexing the size of content and layout (text, media, menus, buttons, etc...) to adjust to the optimal size of the screen it's being viewed on. It's smart for business and it offers a satisfying viewing experience for site visitors.</p>

    <p>Do you have questions about how RWD can help your business? Please fill out the following form and we'll get back to you to discuss how we can help make that happen.</p>
